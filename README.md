**Voting Management System**


This project is a web-based Voting Management System developed using Java and MySQL, bringing efficient voting data management to the web. Key features include:

Java Back-End: Utilizes Java for server-side logic, ensuring secure and efficient processing of voter data.
MySQL Database: Stores all voter information with robust data persistence, allowing scalable and organized data management.
Efficient Data Structures and Algorithms: Doubly linked lists and merge sort are employed to optimize data handling, similar to the console-based version.
File Management: Includes data reading and writing capabilities to ensure data availability and integrity.
This web-based Voting Management System is perfect for understanding the integration of data structures in web applications, offering a seamless and scalable solution for managing voter data.
